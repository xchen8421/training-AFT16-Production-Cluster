By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Apply the security mechanisms defined by the Security Specification to the platform

|===

Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of 

* AFT64
* AFT74
* AFT70
* AFT73

If you're not yet familiar with that topic, please review the sections in the Adopting Confluent book before attempting exercise.

== What problem does it solve?

By default, there is no encryption or authentication, nor are ACLs configured. Any client can communicate to Kafka brokers using the PLAINTEXT port. It is critical that access using this port is restricted to trusted clients only. Network segmentation and/or authorization ACLs can be used to restrict access to trusted IPs in such cases. If neither is used, then the cluster is wide open and can be accessed by anyone.

While non-secured clusters are supported, as are a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients, it is recommended to secure the components in your Confluent deployment.

---

== Why is it important?

Confluent Platform is the central nervous system for a business, uniting your organization around an Apache Kafka®-based single source of truth. It is frequently used to store mission-critical data, and therefore enabling security features are crucial.

---

== Who does this involve?

Engineering manager

Platform engineer (supporting)

InfoSec architect

Operations owner

Application engineer

Application architect

Platform owner

Enterprise architect

---

== When does it matter?

You should address this topic before:

Deploying the Confluent Platform in your organization, or creating your first managed cluster in Confluent Cloud

Onboarding users of the platform to leverage Confluent resources

---

== Security Checklist

You will need to learn about the following:

What authentication mechanisms are available? : https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/overview-authentication-methods.html

What authorization schemes are available in Confluent Platform and Confluent Cloud, and their relative merits? : https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/security/authorization-overview.html 

DW - Should we add a link to a doc here for cloud RBAC?

How to set up authentication for Confluent components and the applications that access them? : https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/incremental-security-upgrade.html

How to enable and configure authorization : https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/security/rbac/enable-rbac-running-cluster.html

How to configure on-the-wire encryption : https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/encryption.html

How to create TLS certificates : https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-security-authorization-authentication-encryption/

How audit logging works within Confluent, and how to enable and access it : https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/security/audit-logs/audit-logs-concepts.html and https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/audit-logging/configure.html

How to configure network security options: https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-network-encryption.html

DW - We should probably link docs to CCloud audit logs as they work a bit differently than in CP.

DW - We should also mention here how network security in terms of FW config also can play a part, but we may want to x-link to the network specifications doc for more details.

**Develop a security design that defines:**

* Which authentication mechanism is to be used given your security requirements and available security infrastructure

* Which authorization method is applicable within your deployment—centralized ACLs or Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)

* What operations are logged in audit logs

* What components are to be secured, and how

Deliver a security checklist for verification that your infrastructure has been correctly secured

Deploy Confluent Platform components with the selected security measures and validate it using the security checklist
