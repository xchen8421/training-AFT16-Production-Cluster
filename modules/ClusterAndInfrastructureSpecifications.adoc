By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Set up clusters per Best Practice Specifications
• Set up the network as per the Network Specification
• Provision the Confluent cluster and deploy any self-managed Confluent components as defined by
the Cluster Specification
• Set up Confluent component monitoring as defined by the Monitoring Specification
• Apply the security mechanisms defined by the Security Specification to the platform
* Anticipate the demands of cluster applications during scaling


|===

Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of:

◦ Managed Cluster

◦ Cluster Sizing

◦ Highly Available Platform Design

◦ Multi-Data Center

◦ Platform Networking

◦ Multi-Data Center

◦ Security Foundations

◦ End-to-End Encryption

◦ Secret Protection Design

◦ User Access Management

◦ Platform Monitoring

◦ Solution Observability

If you're not yet familiar with those topics, please see the sections of the Adopting Confluent book that carry those titles.

== What problem does this solve?

A production Confluent cluster allows you to:

* Stream production data between applications for a single line of business

* Service the anticipated demands of cluster applications as it is used and grows

* Experience real-world data and application workloads to inform future sizing requirements

* Validate and tests architectural specifications made to date
---

== Why is it important?

The production cluster is the initial waypoint for officially bringing streaming data use cases online. The cluster is built on the knowledge and testing done in previous stages, to deliver a working product to a line of business with confidence.
---

== Who does this involve?

This topic is intended for the primary consideration of the platform owner.

The following roles are responsible for implementation:

- Operations engineer

- Platform engineer

== When does it matter?

You must address this topic before onboarding production workloads.

== Production Cluster: Specifications

You will need to do the following:

- Set up the network as per the Network Specification

DW - What is the Network Specification? What should the user consider regarding networking? 
Presumably the user should think about where the producers and consumers will be hosted. If this is a
deployment hosted in a cloud provider (like AWS/GCP/Azure/IBM/Oracle), are you going to colocate your Kafka in the same VPC? Different VPC?
If a different VPC, what connectivity will you establish to ensure all clients are able to access the cluster appropriately. From a security perspective,
are the required security groups or firewall rules configured to allow for not only data plane traffic between clients and kafka, but also 
for cluster management interfaces that may be part of a CI/CD or infra as code process?

- Provision the Confluent cluster and deploy any self-managed Confluent components as defined by the Cluster Specification

DW - What is the Cluster Specification in this context... are we talking about sizing? Instance shape? Actual broker configuration?

- Set up Confluent component monitoring as defined by the Monitoring Specification

DW - What are the monitoring specifications? Is the guidance just Health+ or are we going to include info about c3 or using raw JMX for things like 
Connect, KStreams, KSQLDB and Clients?

- Apply the security mechanisms defined by the Security Specification to the platform

DW - I assume this not only comprises of auth, at rest encryption, in transit encryption, but also access vectors (related to networking). Can we get some examples of
what is in scope for the security spec?

Prior to onboarding workloads, perform the following platform assurance:

- Perform a connectivity test to ensure that all Confluent components are reachable by client applications and working in conjunction with each other

- Validate that you can monitor the health of all platform components

- Validate that the client applications that do not meet the access criteria defined by the Security Specification are unable to do so

== Challenge your understanding

This is the place to try to challenge the learner with thought exercises, actual exercises, or challenges that help to reinforce the instruction.

Think about the needs of for your cluster:

- Non-critical production clusters service the initial use cases for a single line of business. Applications are less critical and the architecture is simplified for ease of management.

- Business-critical production clusters focus on reliability, often across multiple data centers or regions and rely heavily on disaster recovery plans from day one.

- How do you set your team up for success?

- What kind of application(s) are my teams using?

- What is the best infrastructure for your application?

- What is your architectural pattern for your enviroment?
