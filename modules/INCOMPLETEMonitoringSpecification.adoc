**** Note to CDev: Not all concepts will need all of the following headers. Please use what's appropriate and remove the rest. Please incorporate images as much as possible. You can and should adapt this template to accommodate the concept. Please work with the guidance from the SME and work through all the important points. The follow sections are suggestions to help keep the training consistent between both the individual modules and the Adopting Confluent book.

Before we begin you should have a good knowledge of 

Monitoring Specification informed by: 
https://assets.confluent.io/m/14397e757459a58d/original/20200723-WP-Best_Practices_for_Developing_Apache_Kafka_Applications_on_Confluent_Cloud.pdf 
{AFT30}https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/health-plus/index.html and 
{AFT25}https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/tutorials/examples/ccloud-observability/docs/index.html 


If you're not yet familiar with that topic, please see ABC.

== What problem does it solve?

What is the “big picture” here? What are the use cases? Why are we doing this? Why is this relevant? Should be informed/aligned with https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rLFQDGta9qb2ri5fRQhK9WJemoQ0x1SLfGPzRqBhamo/edit#gid=0[company messaging].

---

== Why is it important?

Describing why this topic is important to success with Data in Motion.   

---

== Who does this involve?

A brief paragraph or two explaining who (personas) cares about this topic and what their interaction with it is. 

---

== When does it matter?

A paragraph or two describing when this topic becomes important in the Data in Motion journey and what other topics it builds upon. 

---

== Concept (e.g. Carrying Technical Information)

This is where the instruction on the topic will go. The idea is to keep the training to be around 10 minutes or so. Keep your learner role(s) in mind and also where they are in the AF so that you can make assumptions about what they already know and meet them where they're at.

---

== Challenge your understanding

This is the place to try to challenge the learner with thought exercises, actual exercises, or challenges that help to reinforce the instruction.
