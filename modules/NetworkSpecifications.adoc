By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Ensure the Confluent cluster and components have the necessary network bandwidth

* Restrict communications from outside networks from reaching your platform

* Enable lower latencies in communication due to shorter communication paths

* Add an extra layer of protection to sensitive data stored and processed in Confluent

* Comply with external regulatory rules around PII

* Comply with internal security guidance from your organization’s InfoSec team

|===

Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of 

* AFT06}

* AFT14}

* AFT70}

* AFT28}

* Your hosting infrastructure networking capabilities: These are publicly available in cloud providers, but vary in on-premises installations

* Networking needs in distributed systems:

* How clients access Confluent clusters:

* Confluent Cloud networking options for your cloud provider

* Constraints associated with the chosen networking option

You must have completed the following activities:

Set up an external secrets provider to utilize with the encryption library

Onboard the encryption library with a Professional Services resource

If you're not yet familiar with that topic, please see the parts of adopting Confluent that addresses those sections.



== Challenge your understanding

**You will need to do the following for Confluent Platform :**

* Validate your network fulfills the minimum requirements for Confluent Platform

* Develop a networking design that defines the following based on this doc https://docs.confluent.io/5.4.2/installation/operator/co-endpoints.html:

  * What networking infrastructure is used to fulfill your organization’s requirements

  * Network policies for the internal communication of the Confluent cluster

  * Network policies for the internal communication of Confluent components

  * If using private networks, set up network policies to access the Confluent cluster externally

* Deploy the Confluent Platform cluster in your network

* Ensure any applications/services can communicate with your Confluent installation

Confluent Cloud

**You will need to do the following for Confluent Cloud:**

* Develop a networking design that defines the following based on [this Doc](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/index.html)

  * Networking option that best fits your organization’s needs 

  * The details of the network topology used to communicate with your Confluent Cloud clusters

  * Deploy your Confluent Cloud cluster with the chosen networking option

  * If using a private networking option, accept the peering request or set up private endpoints

* Ensure any applications/services can communicate with your Confluent Cloud cluster

* If using private networking, ensure users can access the Confluent Cloud web console

End-to-End Encyption(
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping)


**You will need to do the following:**

* Obtain and validate access to your KMS provider

* Create a wrapping key on your KMS

* Decide between symmetric or asymmetric keys

* Choose a key rotation policy

* Assign appropriate roles to access the key from the KMS for encryption/decryption

* Add encryption libraries to your applications and provide the necessary configurations

* Validate if end-to-end encryption and decryption are working as expected
