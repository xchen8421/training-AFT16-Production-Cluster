== Validate Monitoring and Observability

You will need to include the following in your plans:

Essential health and performance indicators for Kafka components and client applications: https://developer.confluent.io/podcast/multi-cloud-monitoring-and-observability-with-the-metrics-api-ft-dustin-cote


Identify the primary indicators and alerts, enable metrics gathering, and ensure that you capture the main ones: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/health-plus/telemetry-reporter-metrics.html#telemetry-reporter-metrics


Ensure JMX metrics and monitoring stacks are available for each component and client Java applications: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html 

Integrate with third-party monitoring and log management stacks: https://www.confluent.io/blog/monitor-kafka-clusters-with-prometheus-grafana-and-confluent/

Monitor consumer lag and end-to-end latency: https://support.confluent.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022852491-How-to-Troubleshoot-Consumer-Lag 

For self-managed components, learn to use Confluent Control Center for monitoring and alerting: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/metrics-reporter.html

For cloud-managed components, learn to use Confluent Cloud UI and Metrics API in Confluent Cloud: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/health-plus/index.html

How to deploy distributed tracing in a Kafka ecosystem: https://www.confluent.io/blog/importance-of-distributed-tracing-for-apache-kafka-based-applications/

How to set up Confluent Platform Audit Logs: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/security/audit-logs/audit-logs-concepts.html

How to enable and use Confluent Proactive Support: https://support.confluent.io/hc/en-us/articles/360054685452-How-to-enable-Health-
