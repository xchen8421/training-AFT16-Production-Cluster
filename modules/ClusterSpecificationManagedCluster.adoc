By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Understand the commands and outcomes that go into your production cluster's infrastructure


|===


Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of:

* Cluster Sizing

If you're not yet familiar with this topic, please see the sections of the Adopting Confluent book that carry this title.

== Why is it important?

A fully managed cluster allows you to manage Confluent cluster as a service to abstract the complexity of creating and maintaining a Confluent Cluster.


== Who does this involve?

* Enterprise Architects

* Operations Team

* Infrastructure Team



== When does it matter?

Understanding how to manage your cluster begins when you create your first cluster.

== Match the command to the outcome

Commands

* ccloud create enviroment
* ccloud environment use
* ccloud create cluster
* ccloud kafka cluster use
* ccloud kafka topic create
* ccloud kafka topic produce
* ccloud kafka topic consume

DW - We should update these commands to use the new 'confluent cli v2' nomenclature. Also, do we think its worth showing this workflow using the REST APIs or Terraform provider instead?

Outcome

* Generates enviroment ID and creates enviroment name
* Sets active enviroment
* Generates cluster type, endpoint, API endpoint, availibility
* Displays ingress, egress, storage, provider, region, and status
* Sets active cluster
* Generates new topic
* Enters manual data into a topic
* Recieves manual data from a topic
